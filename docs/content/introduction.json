As a necessity a new programming language needed to be devised by the name Infinity. The programming language works in a different manner for different scenarios. If used within the compiled code runtime environment, it functions as a compiled programming language, while if used in an outside environment (such as in ISCJS) it functions as a scripting language, hence the name InfinityScript."
